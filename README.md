Homelab — GitOps Kubernetes Platform

A reproducible Kubernetes homelab platform built using Terraform + Argo CD + HELM, with integrated observability and a real application deployment to demonstrate end-to-end delivery.

This project mirrors production-grade DevOps practices in a lightweight local environment.

What this project demonstrates

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
GitOps workflow with Argo CD as the single source of truth
Declarative Kubernetes deployments with HELM
Observability-first mindset (metrics, logs, dashboards)
Real application deployment to validate the platform
